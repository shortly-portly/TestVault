### What I Learnt
* `artisan make:model <model-name> -m` will create a model and an associated migration.
```bash
artisan make:model Category -m
```
creates
```bash
Model created successfully.
Created Migration: 2022_02_18_183519_create_categories_table
```

Notice how is creates the correct plural of category for the migration :-).

### Adding a relationship to a model
```php
    public function category()
    {
        return $this->belongsTo(Category::class);
    }
```

To retrieve category information:
```php
$post->category
```
Note: not `$post->category()` which returns a `Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\BelongsTo` instance.
