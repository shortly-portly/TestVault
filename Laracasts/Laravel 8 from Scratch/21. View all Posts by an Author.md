### What I Learnt
* `latest` method allows the ordering of results by date:
```php
        'posts' => Post::latest()->with('category')->get()
```

* If a relationship is correct but could be better expressed due to the nature of the relationship:
	* For example a Post is written by a user so you'd have `$post->user`, but in the real world you'd say a Post is written by an author so `$post->author`.
	* In this case rather than:
```php
 public function user()
    {
        return $this->belongsTo(User::class);
    }
```
* You can write
```php
    public function author()
    {
        return $this->belongsTo(User::class, 'user_id');
    }
```
* Note we need to tell the `belongs_to` method that the foreign key is `user_id` otherwise Laravel would assume it was `author_id`.
* The above isn't strictly necessary but it does allow for the provision of more descriptive code.

----
* `load` is the equivalent of `with` on a model instance
```php
Route::get('/', function () {
    return view('posts', [
        'posts' => Post::latest()->with('category', 'author')->get()
    ]);
});
```

```php
Route::get('/authors/{author:username}', function (User $author) {
    return view('posts', [
        'posts' => $author->posts->load(['category', 'author'])
    ]);
});
```
