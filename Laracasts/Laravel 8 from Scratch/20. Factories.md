### What I Learnt
* Factories seem to have had some form of change in Laravel 8
	* For example they no longer reference the model (as shown in the Laracast episode)

* All Models are created with a Factory [[trait]].

*  To create a Factory for a Model:
```bash
artisan make:factory PostFactory
```

* Possible to create a model with a combination of:
	* controller
	* factory
	* migration
	* seed

For example
```bash
artisan make:model Comment -mf
```
would create a Model, a Migration and a Factory.

Factories for Related Data
* Factories allow you to create a model and associated models
```php
$user->posts()->createMany(

factory(App\Post::class, 3)->make()->toArray()

);
```
