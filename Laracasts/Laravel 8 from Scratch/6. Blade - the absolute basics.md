### What I learnt
* The basics of Blade, Laravels templating engine.
* Blade templates get compiled to standard PHP
* The storage directory.
* @foreach and the loop variable


### Blade templates get compiled to standard PHP
* A Blade template, `posts.blade.php` get compiled down to a standard PHP file.
* The PHP file can be found in:
```bash
storage\framework\views
```

```php
{{ $post-> body }}
```

becomes

```php
<?php echo e($post->body); ?>
```

* Blade templates are escaped by default
* To display the content without escaping use:
```php
{!! $post-> body !!}
```

### @foreach and the loop variable
* When looping in Blade you get access to the loop variable which comes with a number of properties:

| property|detail
|---------|-----|
| index | the index of the current loop iteration |
| iteration | the current loop iteration |
| remaining | the iterations remaining in the loop |
| count | the total number of items in the array being iterated |
| first | whether this is the first iteration through the loop|
| last | whether this is the last iteration through the loop |
| even | whether this is an even iteration through the loop |
| odd | whether this is an odd iteration through the loop |
| depth | the nesting level of the current loop |
| parent | when in a nested loop, the parent loop variable |

* The `loop variable` is useful for all sorts of things
* Want to add a class only if the item is even?

```php
<article class="{{ $loop->even ? 'my-even-class' : '' }}">
```
