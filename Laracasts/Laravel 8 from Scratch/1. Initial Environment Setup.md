Create a new Laravel project:

```bash
composer create-project laravel/laravel <project name>
```

* Note laravel/laravel is the Github repository

Alternative Approach
* The Laravel Installer
```bash
composer global require laravel/installer
```

* This will install the Laravel Installer globally.
* Composer global bin directory needs to be part of the system path.
* The directory can be found at:
```bash
/Users/davidsimmons/.composer/vendor/bin
```

* Add to the paths defines in `.zprofile`.
* Once added you can type:
```bash
laravel new <project name>
```

__TODO__
* Consider doing the optional `HTML and CSS Workshop`
