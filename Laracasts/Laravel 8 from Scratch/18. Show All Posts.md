### What I Learnt
* TODO: Better understand what `$guarded = []` actually achieves.
* TODO: Ensure you know the difference between an eloquent method that is done in PHP vs one done in the database - essentially resides around:
	* To the left of a `get()` is done in the database, to the right is done in PHP.
	* Doing stuff in the database is always faster
	* Learn them features of the database you are using - don't strive to be database agnostic - use their power.
