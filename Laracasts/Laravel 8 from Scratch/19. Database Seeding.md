### What I Learnt
* Seeding a Database
	* `DatabaseSeeder.php` has the following:
```php
class DatabaseSeeder extends Seeder
{
    /**
     * Seed the application's database.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function run()
    {
        \App\Models\User::factory(10)->create();
    }
}
```

If we run:
```bash
artisan db:seed
```
This will create 10 `user` records in the database.

----
* Recreating the database and seeding at the same time
```bash
artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

* Delete all entries in a database
```php
        User::truncate();
        Category::truncate();
```
* Include this at the top of the `run` method in the `DatabaseSeeder` class to remove the risk of duplicate key errors when re-running the database seeder.
